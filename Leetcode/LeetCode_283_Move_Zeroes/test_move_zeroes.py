# 1.Forgetting to move trailing zeros -> wrong expected comparison.
# 2.Accidentally returning a value -> ret is None fails.

# Bug it catches:
# Accidentally creating and returning a new list instead of mutating the original.

  assert arr[:len(nonzeros)] == nonzeros  # Check the order of non-zero elements is preserved
  assert all(x == 0 for x in arr[len(nonzeros):])  # Check the rest are zeros

# What itâ€™s proving:
# The relative order of non-zero items is unchanged (a key requirement).
# After placing all non-zeros at the front, everything after that is zero.

# Bug it catches:
# Any solution that shuffles non-zeros (e.g., unstable swaps or improper writes).
